    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p>I am a young aspiring web developer who has a background in IT and cybersecurity. I am expanding my skillset to be more versatile and well-rounded. Outside of development and security, my primary interest is powerlifting. I started my fitness journey years ago and it is one of my top goals to become a national-level powerlifter.</p>
